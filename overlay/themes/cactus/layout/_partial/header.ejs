<section id="about">
      <h1>Hello :)</h1>
      
      <p>I'm Nick Stinemates aka <code>keeb</code>! Thanks for stopping by.</p> 
      
      <p>I've been hopelessly passionate about development, automation, and building software for as long as I can remember.</p>

      <p>You'll usually find me at home, hanging out in my own personal datacenter. It's like my little playground, where I'm constantly iterating on technology that I find interesting and finding outlets to publish and share. I've been <a href="2022/05/28/The-beginning/">hooked on computers</a> since way back when I was coding in Visual Basic on good ol' America Online.</p>
      
      <p>Throughout my career, I've made some pretty cool contributions in the Open Source world. One of my proudest moments was playing a major role in the development of Docker. I had the opportunity to collaborate with an expansive ecosystem of builders. It was a thrilling journey that pushed the boundaries of modern software development.</p>
      
      <p>But here's what really gets me going: bridging the gap between tech and business. I've worked at some other great companies like Kentik, MariaDB, and Rancher Labs. I've been all about driving killer go-to-market strategies and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in enterprise container management and network observability solutions.</p> 
            
      <p>It's not just about the tech for me. I genuinely love helping others succeed, whether it's through open-source tech or just lending a hand. This is a collection of things I am working on or thinking about, in the hopes that you might it useful.</p>
